Dating app based on music taste!
We realized that one of the great cause of contact between people is music, so we decided to develop a dating application that basically works like 'Tinder' but shows the users only people with same taste in music.
It works with API from Spotify - when registering our system, the user require to approve Spotify sign up in order to get his top artists and tracks.
With the matching algorithm we developed, the system knows what people to show the user.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Run the application

The system has been deployed to Netlify and available here:
http://Spotinder.netlify.com

## Register

In order to register the application, you need to contact one of us so we can add your email address to spotify, by spotify policy.

## Login

We created for you 2 users you can login with, with match between them so you can see full functionality of the system:
### user1
email: ofir@email.com
password: 1234
### user2
email: Ofir@test.test
password: 1234
